Description: PyWeather
        =========
        
        Abstract
        --------
        
        PyWeather contains weather related modules implemented in Python.
        Anything weather related is fair game for PyWeather.  Currently
        PyWeather is limited to unit conversion, console reading, and data
        publication.  But, future work can be added to PyWeather in any area.
        
        
        Unit Conversion
        ---------------
        
        PyWeather has a lot of support for common unit conversions in
        distance, temperature, pressure, and volume.  Conversion from
        Fahrenheit to Celsius, and kelvin is supported, as well as conversions
        between inches of mercury and millibars.
        
        
        Station Observations
        --------------------
        
        PyWeather also contains modules that are capable of downloading
        observations from weather consoles.  The current list of supported
        weather consoles includes:
        
        - Davis Vantage Pro
        - Davis Vantage Pro2
        
        
        Data Publication
        ----------------
        
        PyWeather contains a module that allows developers to post conditions
        to weather aggregation sites. The current list of support services includes:
        
        - WeatherUnderground (wundgerground.com)
        - PWS Weather        (pwsweather.com)
        - WeatherForYou      (weatherforyou.com)
